# Data Warehouse Project - Sales Data Integration

## Overview

This project focuses on the creation of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems (ERP and CRM). The goal is to enable efficient analytical reporting and decision-making. We follow the Medallion Architecture to ensure data quality, scalability, and performance.

## Objective

* **Develop a Data Warehouse** to integrate and clean sales data from ERP and CRM systems.
* **Optimize data** for analytical reporting and business insights.
* **Ensure Data Quality** by cleansing, validating, and transforming data before it’s used in analytical reports.
* **Provide Clear Documentation** of the data model for stakeholders and analytics teams.

## Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, which organizes data processing into three primary layers: **Bronze (Raw), Silver (Validated), and Gold (Business)**.

### Layers of the Medallion Architecture

1. **Bronze (Raw) Layer**

   * Raw data is ingested from source systems without transformations.
   * Serves as a historical record of all data entering the warehouse.
   * Data is stored in its original format for reference and auditability.

2. **Silver (Validated) Layer**

   * Data is cleaned and transformed into a more usable format.
   * Handles data quality issues and standardization, creating a reliable foundation for analytical queries.

3. **Gold (Business) Layer**

   * Most refined data, optimized for business reporting needs.
   * Includes aggregated tables, materialized views, and dimension models.
   * Presents business-ready formats for users and ensures high performance for analytical queries.

### Data Structures and Implementation

1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**

   * Tables mirror the structure of source data (ERP and CRM).
   * Minimal transformations to preserve original data integrity.

2. **Silver Layer (Validated Data)**

   * Tables for cleaned and validated data.
   * Transformation processes ensure consistency, standardization, and quality.

3. **Gold Layer (Business Data)**

   * Optimized views and tables for analytical use.
   * Aggregated and pre-calculated metrics to improve query performance.

### Key Concepts

* **Dimension Tables:** Contain descriptive information, such as products, customers, and time.
* **Fact Tables:** Store transactional data (e.g., sales transactions, orders).
* **Staging Tables:** Temporary tables for intermediate data during ETL processes.
* **Business Views:** Provide curated data specific to business reporting needs.
* **Security Views:** Implement row-level security by filtering data based on user permissions.

### Benefits of This Architecture

* **Separation of Concerns:** Different layers focus on different needs: raw data storage, data transformation, and business-ready data.
* **Performance Optimization:** Indexed tables and views ensure fast query performance.
* **Flexibility:** Views abstract complex logic, making it easier to evolve the system without affecting the data storage.
* **Maintainability:** Clear separation between raw data and business logic for easier troubleshooting and enhancements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* SQL Server (or compatible relational database system)
* Access to the source systems (ERP and CRM data in CSV format)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-warehouse.git
   cd data-warehouse
   ```

2. **Create the database:**
   Set up a new SQL Server database to store the data warehouse.

3. **Load Source Data:**
   Load the raw ERP and CRM CSV files into the **Bronze Layer** tables.

4. **Run Transformation Scripts:**
   Apply data cleansing, validation, and transformation processes to move data from the Bronze Layer to the Silver Layer.

5. **Generate Business Views:**
   Create views and tables in the Gold Layer for reporting and analytics.

6. **Secure the Data:**
   Implement row-level security if necessary, based on user roles and permissions.

### Folder Structure

```
/data-warehouse
    ├── /bronze
    │   ├── bronze_data_load.sql    # Load raw data into the Bronze layer
    │   ├── bronze_data_quality.sql # Clean and validate raw data
    ├── /silver
    │   ├── silver_data_transform.sql  # Data transformation for the Silver layer

```

### Documentation

For detailed information on the data model, tables, and relationships between entities, refer to [data\_model\_documentation.md](./docs/data_model_documentation.md).

## Usage

Once the data warehouse is set up and the data has been loaded and transformed:

1. Use the **Gold Layer views** for business reporting.
2. Query the **aggregated metrics** from the Gold Layer to get quick insights.
3. Implement security at the view level to ensure only authorized users can access specific datasets.

### Sample Query

To fetch sales data by product category and region:

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_category,
    r.region,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM
    gold.sales_fact f
JOIN
    gold.product_dim p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN
    gold.region_dim r ON f.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY
    p.product_category, r.region;
```
